# Klyshko Operator

The *Klyshko Operator* is the brain of the Klyshko subsystem. A set of
Kubernetes [Controllers][k8s-controllers] is used to drive the lifecycle of jobs
(VC-level) and tasks (VCP-level) and to decide when jobs are to be scheduled
based on observing tuple availability in [Castor].

For a high-level description of the Klyshko subsystem, its components, and how
these interact, please see the [README] at the root of this repository.

## Additional License Information

Most of the files in the `config` folder are scaffolded or auto-generated by the
[Operator SDK][opsdk]. These files inherit the license from the Operator SDK,
i.e., are distributed under the Apache 2 license. Some files are handcrafted by
the authors of Carbyne Stack and as such carry an explicit license header.

# Klyshko Provisioner

Uploads tuples generated by a *Correlated Randomness Generator* (CRG) to
[Castor] using the Carbyne Stack [CLI]. In accordance with the
[Klyshko Integration Interface (KII)][kii], tuples are read from the path made
available in the environment variable `KII_TUPLE_FILE`, uploaded as tuples of
the type given in `KII_TUPLE_TYPE`, and with the chunk identifier specified in
`KII_JOB_ID`.

For a high-level description of the Klyshko subsystem, its components, and how
these interact, please see the [README] at the root of this repository.

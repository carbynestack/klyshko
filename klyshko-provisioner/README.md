# Klyshko Provisioner

Uploads tuples generated by a CRG to [Castor] using the Carbyne Stack [CLI].
According to the [Klyshko Integration Interface (KII)][kii] tuples are read from
the path made available in the environment variable `KII_TUPLE_FILE`, uploaded
as tuples of type given in `KII_TUPLE_TYPE` with the chunk identifier specified
in `KII_JOB_ID`.
